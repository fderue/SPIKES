# SPIKES : Superpixel-Keypoints Structure for Robust Visual Tracking

SPiKeS-T is a model-free tracker I developed during my master of research. Given an initial bounding box around a target, the tracker is able to locate that target in the following frames. More details can be found in my <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07238v1.pdf">paper</a> which is currently in review.
