# SPIKES : Superpixel-Keypoints Structure for Robust Visual Tracking

SPiKeS-T is a model-free tracker I developed during my master of research. Given an initial bounding box surrounding the target, the tracker is able to locate that target in the following frames of the video. More details can be found in my <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07238v1.pdf">paper</a> which is currently in review.
